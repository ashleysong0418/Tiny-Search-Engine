# Tiny Search Engine

### Overview:
This TSE utilizes data structures such as hashtables, sets, and counters to mimic a search engine. There are three parts to this program. 
1) Crawler
2) Indexer
3) Querier

Each subdirectory holds the IMPLEMENTATION.md and DESIGN.md that describes the data structures used and the pseudocode/methodology used to create this program. 

Within each subdirectory, testing files are given to show the various accepted inputs and their outputs. 


To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.
